# SearchEngine
Search Engine project for Numerical Methods (University Course) using Python.  
Main idea behind the projext was to firstly download a large set of texts from the internet.  
Then display each text as a N-dimensional vector, where N is number of diffrent words in these texts.  
This way when we get input of few words from user, we can create new N-dimensional vector and check which  
of texts is the closest to user input.  
It allows us to return texts that fits best to the given input.
